# Awake.py

"Awake.py" is an AI-powered alert system designed to keep you awake and productive. It works by analyzing live footage from your computer's webcam to determine if you are awake and alert or starting to doze off. If the system detects signs of sleepiness, it plays unexpected audio cues to jolt you back into focus. By using a custom-trained object detection model, the software can accurately recognize changes in your alertness, making it a useful tool for staying on track during long work or study sessions.
